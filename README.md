# Automation-with-Python

This project contains my personal take and some solutions i found around and put together for various Automation Tasks using Python.

### Introduction:

This is designed to help you enhance your Python skills and provide examples for each situation that can be automate. Whether you are a beginner looking to build a few automation scripts or an experienced developer aiming to refresh your Python knowledge, this is tailored for everyone.
### Key Features:

- **Diverse Automation Coding Examples and Challenges:** Explore a wide range of Python programming concepts that help automate tasks.
- **Real-world Applications:** Apply your Python skills to real-world scenarios, use the presented ideas.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Tailor the coding examples to your specific interests and goals.

### Project Structure:

- **Task specific folders.** These contain the task to be automated and including any prerequisite files.
- **task_specific.py files.** These contain the examples used for automating various tasks. The files may contain several approaches to solve the same issue. Feel free to chose the one you like.

  
### Requirements:

Please make sure that the required libraries, frameworks and sometimes the example files are installed and available in the root directory for proper project functionality.

### Installation:

1. **Fork this repository:**
   
   Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy of these Selenium automation scripts.

2. **Clone your forked repository:**

   Copy and run the desired files or project folders.

### Usage:

### Task specific folders and task_specific.py files.

To use the files you are intrested in:

1. Copy the content of "Task specific folder".
2. Paste the content into a new Python file (e.g., `your_file.py`) in case the flow does not require any prequisite files.
3. Save the file look over, read the comments, modify, adapt and run it.

Feel free to modify and adapt the files based on your specific requirements.


### Description:
**Task specific folder** : contains all the files required to achieve the automation process refered in the name of the folder.
**task_specific.py** : contains comments and sometimes multiple solutions to the specific task.
